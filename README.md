# FitQ
This was a project created for VandyHacks 2019. 

## What it does
The project uses physical health data like time spent sleeping, heart rate, and activities performed throughout the day and combines these with a person's mood to generate a suggestion for how to improve your daily wellness!

## Inspiration
The problem we tried to solve is that people do not understand themselves well enough sometimes. This can manifest in a variety of ways; for example, someone may be angry and not know why they're angry. Behavior and mood can also affect human health and life expectancy; for example, chronic stress is thought to lead to premature death. 

As college students, we are familiar with how mental unwellness can result in devastating consequences to grades, careers, social lives, and, of course, health. There innumerable stressors in everyone's lives and how we react, or deal with, these stressors often determines how we feel and our future responses to stressors. But not everybody has a chance to be educated about the connection between mental heath, physical health, and success. Even those who are aware of these important links may not always remember the importance of these. 

## Technologies Used
The WebApp was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The FitBit WebAPI was utilized to provide health data and computations were performed using research about the link between physical health and emotional wellbeing. 

## What's next for FitQ
We want to expand the analysis of health data and find cheaper alternatives to a FitBit Ionic. We really feel that the link between mental and physical wellbeing has not been sufficiently explored using technology to better people's education. A major goal for us is making something like a health tracker available to those in less fortunate circumstances or where the infrastructure is not able to support high technological throughput.
